# Final Paper

When building for the first time, make sure to build a few times to properly compile the table of contents.

Tex is basically the one and only situation where compiling it again if it doesn't work the first time will work.

## Editing the document

Each major section of the paper has been split into its own `.tex` file which will be automatically combined into the final document during compilation.
Changes for each section should be put in their respective file, not `iqp.tex`.

## Compiling the document

I would recommend using a TeX editor such as [texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker) to edit the document.
It is possible to edit and compile from a plain text editor and command line, but dedicated software significantly improves the experience.

If you're using a debian-based Linux distribution, you can install texmaker by running `sudo apt install texmaker`.
If you're running Windows 10 or OSX, go to their [downloads page](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html) to download the latest package.
