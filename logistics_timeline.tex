\nchapter{Project Logistics, Timeline, and Milestones}

\par Week one, we spent brainstorming ideas for projects. We landed on Toilet Paper as a Service. This week we spent time figuring out how we are going to build our smart toilet paper device. Week three, we plan to start prototyping our device, starting off by making templates out of cardboard and then creating the mechanical side of our project out of wood and other materials. Week four, we are planning to continue prototyping. Week five, we plan to test and debug our smart toilet paper device. Our major milestones are prototyping, testing, and debugging our device.
