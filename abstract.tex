\par Because traffic congestion often has impacts on safety, visitor experience, resources, emergency response times, and park operations, reducing congestion is an important management topic for Acadia National Park.  This project explores the use of remote webcams to monitor parking lots and other areas of interest within the park, with the ability to upload images in real time to the Acadia park website where they can be viewed by the public and Acadia management personnel.  This strategy is being explored to help mitigate traffic congestion.
