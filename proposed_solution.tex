\nchapter{Proposed Solution}

% Introduction to solution
\par Our proposed solution to the issue of restricting and controlling access to ones precious toilet paper reserves is an internet connected roll dispenser system.  Within the system, a store of up to 6 rolls of toilet paper can be kept at the ready, yet securely contained within the body of the unit.  When access to a new roll is desired, the user may utilize a cell phone to request access to the dispenser, which after validating the request, instructs the dispenser to release a single roll of paper, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:request_and_release_flow}
