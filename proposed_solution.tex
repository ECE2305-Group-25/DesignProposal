\nchapter{Proposed Solution}

% Introduction to solution
\par Our proposed solution to the issue of restricting and controlling access to ones precious toilet paper reserves is an internet connected roll dispenser system.  Within the system, a store of up to 6 rolls of toilet paper can be kept at the ready, yet securely contained within the body of the unit.  When access to a new roll is desired, the user may utilize a cell phone to request access to the dispenser, which after validating the request, instructs the dispenser to release a single roll of paper, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:request_and_release_flow}.\\

% Electronic Control
\par In order to facilitate the release of the rolls, a system of electromechanical actuators can be utilized to ensure that access to the roll input hatch is only granted to an authorized user, and the ability to retrieve a new roll from the bottom of the device is only possible through authentication and verification via a control application.\\

% Internet Interface
\par Due to the importance of being able to effectively monitor, manage, and control the device even when not in the immediate proximity of the unit, some method of remotely accessing the device must be employed.  There are many methods available for long distance remote control however none are as effective as taking advantage of mankind's greatest piece of technological infrastructure; the internet.  Connecting the device to the internet not only allows for easy and effective remote management of the device, but also allows for users to easily connect to and request paper from the device.\\

% Control Software
\par The final component of a solution is a software application the user can interact with in order to request and obtain access to the toilet paper.  Such an application can manifest as either a web server which serves a live interactive application to the user, or as a standalone application installed onto the users device which sends authentication and control signals directly to the toilet paper roll dispenser for verification and execution.
